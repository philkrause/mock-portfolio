        React also known as React.js or ReactJS is a JavaScript library for
        building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community
        of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in
        the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it's optimal
        only for its intended use of being the quickest method to fetch rapidly
        changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only
        the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React
        applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state
        management, routing, and interaction with an API.

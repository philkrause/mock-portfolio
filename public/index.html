          React also known as React.js or ReactJS is a JavaScript library for
          building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community
          of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in
          the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it's optimal
          only for its intended use of being the quickest method to fetch
          rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching
          data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why
          complex React applications usually require the use of additional
          libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
